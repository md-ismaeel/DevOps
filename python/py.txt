OBJECTS

1. List
- Ordered and changeable collection

2. Dictionary
- Stores data in key-value pairs

3. Set
- Unordered collection with unique values

4. Tuple
- Ordered and unchangeable collection

OBJECTS WITH EXAMPLES

1. List
- Ordered and changeable
- Allows duplicate values

Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Ali", "Sara", "John"]

2. Dictionary
- Stores data in key-value pairs
- Keys are unique

Example:
student = {
    "name": "Ali",
    "age": 20,
    "course": "Python"
}

3. Set
- Unordered collection
- Does not allow duplicate values

Example:
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

4. Tuple
- Ordered but unchangeable (immutable)

Example:
coordinates = (10, 20)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

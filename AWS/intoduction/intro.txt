AWS is a leading cloud computing platform by Amazon that provides on-demand access to IT resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, security, and DevOps tools over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, users can rent computing power and services from AWS and pay only for what they use.

• Hosting websites and applications
• Storing and processing large amounts of data

Key benefits of AWS include:
• Scalability – easily scale up or down
• Reliability – high availability across regions

• Cost efficiency – pay-as-you-go pricing

AWS helps developers, startups, and enterprises build fast, secure, and globally available applications.

# 🟢 AWS Learning Roadmap for MERN Stack Developers

As a MERN developer, you don’t need to master all of AWS. Focus on the services that help you **deploy, scale, and secure** your apps.

---

## 🔹 Level 1 – Basics (Must-Know for Any MERN Dev)

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** → Run your Node.js/Express backend on a virtual server.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** → Store images, videos, or static React build files.
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** → Manage users, permissions, and access keys securely.
- **Route 53** → Domain management and DNS.
- **Certificate Manager + CloudFront** → Free SSL certificates and CDN for React frontend.

---

## 🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate (For Production-Ready Apps)

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)** → Use MySQL/Postgres if needed.
- **DocumentDB / MongoDB Atlas on AWS** → Managed MongoDB hosting.
- **Elastic Beanstalk** → Easy deployment of Node.js apps without managing infra.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service) / EKS (Kubernetes)** → Deploy Dockerized MERN apps.
- **CloudWatch** → Monitoring, logs, and alerts.
- **Secrets Manager / Parameter Store** → Securely store DB credentials, JWT secrets, etc.

---

## 🔹 Level 3 – Advanced (For Scaling + DevOps Roles)

- **CI/CD (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy)** → Automate deployment from GitHub/GitLab.
- **API Gateway + Lambda** → Build serverless functions (e.g., email, payments).
- **SNS / SQS** → Messaging queues for notifications & background jobs.
- **CloudFormation / CDK / Terraform** → Infrastructure as Code (IAC).

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **If your goal is just to deploy and host MERN apps:**  
  Focus on **EC2, S3, CloudFront, Route 53, IAM, Elastic Beanstalk**.

- **If you want to grow as Full-Stack + DevOps engineer:**  
  Add **Docker, ECS/EKS, CI/CD, API Gateway, Lambda**.

## 📅 Suggested Timeline

### 30 Days (Beginner)

- Learn **EC2, S3, IAM**.
- Deploy a MERN app manually.

### 60 Days (Intermediate)

- Add **Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFront, Route 53**.
- Use **CloudWatch** for monitoring.

### 90 Days (Advanced)

- Learn **Docker + ECS/EKS**.
- Automate deployments with **CI/CD**.
- Explore **Lambda + API Gateway** for serverless features.
